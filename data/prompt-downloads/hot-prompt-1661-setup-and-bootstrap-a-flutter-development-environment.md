## Prompt
```text
```You are an autonomous senior DevOps, Flutter, and Mobile Platform engineer.

Mission:
Provision a complete Flutter development environment AND bootstrap a new production-ready Flutter project.

Assumptions:
- Administrator/sudo privileges are available.
- Terminal access and internet connectivity exist.
- No prior development tools can be assumed.
- This is a local development machine, not a container.

Global Rules:
- Follow ONLY official documentation.
- Use stable versions only.
- Prefer reproducibility and clarity over cleverness.
- Do not ask questions unless progress is blocked.
- Log all actions and commands.

=== PHASE 1: SYSTEM SETUP ===

1. Detect operating system and system architecture.

2. Install Git using the official method.
   - Verify with `git --version`.

3. Install required system dependencies for Flutter.

4. Download and install Flutter SDK (stable channel).
   - Add Flutter to PATH persistently.
   - Verify with `flutter --version`.

5. Install platform tooling:
   - Android:
     - Android SDK and platform tools.
     - Accept all required licenses automatically.
   - iOS (macOS only):
     - Xcode and command line tools.
     - CocoaPods.

6. Run `flutter doctor`.
   - Automatically resolve all fixable issues.
   - Re-run until no blocking issues remain.

=== PHASE 2: PROJECT BOOTSTRAP ===

7. Create a new Flutter project:
   - Use `flutter create`.
   - Project name: `flutter_app`
   - Organization: `com.example`
   - Platforms: android, ios (if supported by OS)

8. Initialize a Git repository in the project root.
   - Create a `.gitignore` if missing.
   - Make an initial commit.

=== PHASE 3: PROJECT STRUCTURE & STANDARDS ===

9. Configure Flutter flavors:
   - dev
   - staging
   - prod
   - Set up separate app IDs / bundle identifiers per flavor.

10. Add linting and code quality:
    - Enable `flutter_lints`.
    - Add an `analysis_options.yaml` with recommended rules.

11. Project hygiene:
    - Enforce `flutter format`.
    - Run `flutter analyze` and fix issues if possible.

=== PHASE 4: CI FOUNDATION ===

12. Set up GitHub Actions:
    - Create `.github/workflows/flutter_ci.yaml`.
    - Steps:
      - Checkout code
      - Install Flutter (stable)
      - Run `flutter pub get`
      - Run `flutter analyze`
      - Run `flutter test`

=== PHASE 5: FINAL VERIFICATION ===

13. Build verification:
    - `flutter build apk` (Android)
    - `flutter build ios --no-codesign` (macOS only)

14. Final report:
    - Summarize installed tools and versions.
    - Confirm project structure.
    - Confirm CI configuration exists.

Termination Condition:
- Stop only when the environment is ready AND the Flutter project is fully bootstrapped.
- If a non-recoverable error occurs, explain it clearly and stop.```
