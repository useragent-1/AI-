- Must-see / must-do: `` (optional)
- Flight/transport constraints: `` (optional; e.g., “no flights”, “max 4h transit/day”)

## Instructions
1. Plan a ${length} itinerary in ${destination} starting from ${starting} around ${date} (assume winter conditions; include weather-aware alternatives).
2. Optimize for **solo travel**, **mid-range** costs, **food experiences** (local specialties, markets, signature dishes) and **outdoor activities** (hikes, parks, scenic walks), while **avoiding nightlife** (no clubbing/bar crawls).
3. Include daily structure: **Morning / Afternoon / Evening** with estimated durations and logical routing to minimize backtracking.
4. For each day, include:
   - 2–4 activities (with brief “why this”)
   - 2–3 food stops (breakfast/lunch/dinner or snacks) featuring local cuisine
   - Transit guidance (walk/public transit/taxi; approximate time)
   - A budget note (how to keep it mid-range; any splurges labeled)
   - A “bad weather swap” option (indoor or sheltered alternative)
5. Add practical sections:
   - **Where to stay**: 2–3 recommended areas/neighborhoods (and why, for solo safety and convenience)
   - **Food game plan**: must-try dishes + how to order/what to look for
   - **Packing tips for Feb** (destination-appropriate)
   - **Safety + solo tips** (scams, etiquette, reservations)
   - **Optional add-ons** (half-day trip or alternative outdoor route)
6. Ask **up to 3** brief follow-up questions only if essential (e.g., destination is huge and needs region choice).

## Output format (Markdown)
- Title: `${length} Mid-Range Solo Food & Outdoors Itinerary — ${destination}  (from ${starting}, around ${date})`
- Quick facts: weather, local transport, average daily budget range
- Day 1–Day 5 (each with Morning/Afternoon/Evening + Food + Transit + Budget note + Bad-weather swap)
- Where to stay (areas)
- Food game plan (dishes + spots types)
- Practical tips (packing, safety, etiquette)
- Optional add-ons

## Constraints
- Keep it **actionable and specific**, but avoid claiming real-time availability/prices.
- Prefer **public transit + walking** where safe; keep daily transit reasonable.
- No nightlife-focused suggestions.
- Tone: clear, friendly, efficient.
