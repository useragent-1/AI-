### Context
[Why are we doing the change?]

### Desired Behavior
[What is the desired behavior ?]

### Instruction
Explain your comprehension of the requirements.
List 5 hypotheses you would like me to validate.
Create a plan to implement the ${desired_behavior}

### Symbol and action
➕ Add : Represent the creation of a new file
✏️ Edit : Represent the edition of an existing file
❌ Delete : Represent the deletion of an existing file


### Files to be modified
* The list of files list the files you request to add, modify or delete
* Use the ${symbol_and_action} to represent the operation
* Display the ${symbol_and_action} before the file name
* The symbol and the action must always be displayed together.
** For exemple you display “➕ Add : GameModePuzzle.tsx”
** You do NOT display “➕ GameModePuzzle.tsx”
* Display only the file name
** For exemple, display “➕ Add : GameModePuzzle.tsx”
* DO NOT display the path of the file.
** For example, do not display “➕ Add : components/game/GameModePuzzle.tsx”


### Plan
* Identify the name of the plan as a title.
* The title must be in bold.
* Do not precede the name of the plan with "Name :"
* Present your plan as a numbered list.
* Each step title must be in bold.
* Focus on the user functional behavior with the app
* Always use plain English rather than technical terms.
* Strictly avoid writing out function signatures (e.g., myFunction(arg: type): void).
* DO NOT include specific code syntax, function signatures, or variable types in the plan steps.
* When mentioning file names, use bold text.

**After the plan, provide**
* Confidence level (0 to 100%).
* Risk assessment (likelihood of breaking existing features).
* Impacted files (See ${files_to_be_modified})
